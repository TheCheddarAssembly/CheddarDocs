##### Mission & Objective
- Mission: **Do what others cannot in Tarkov.**
- Manifestation: whatcha Create an organized group of trusted members with the sole focus of developing a tactical experience in Tarkov.
	- The goal with this is to capture an elevated tactical experience beyond what's ever been seen in Tarkov.
	- Tarkov is a naturally chaotic game, and the optimal way to play involves less-than-tactical methods (see: Pestily)
	- However, the goal is not to play optimally, but to min-max the teamwork aspect by emulating real-world elite forces and develop our own methodologies.
	- ![[Frame 1.png]]
	- Why do this?
		1. This is sort of a "lite role play" experience, so if you like that, then there you go.
		2. Capture content that others cannot.
		3. Make a reputation in the Tarkov-sphere for operating as a near-mythological boss-like group.
	- Will we only emulate special forces?
		- Yes and no.
		- While our tactics will always be elevated past the highest level known in Tarkov, we will seek to diversify our playstyles when the time is right to emulate different units within the tactical world (ex: SEALs vs Spetsnaz).


##### Organization Structure
- The Cheddar Assembly will operate on a simple member status system.
	- VIP
		- Reserved for special instances where a non-member or guest is invited to join us.
		- Guests should be treated as VIPs and accommodated as much as possible.
		- Allowing VIPs to die is considered a major failure.
	- Specialist
		- Standard members of TCA.
	- Team Leader
		- In-game leaders who will be asked to provide leadership on the field in Tarkov.
	- VP (Vice President)
		- Out-of-game leaders who provide a specialized service to the community (ex: socials, organization, documentation, etc)
	- President - Founder
- Upon joining TCA, every member must choose a callsign that is a known type of cheese that no other member has currently.

#### Decision Making
- Critical decisions will be made using a group vote, with the President having the ability to veto if they feel it goes against the mission of TCA.
